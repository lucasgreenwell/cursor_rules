When the user responds to a feature that you've implemented according to [checklists.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/checklists.mdc) and documented according to [docs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/docs.mdc) with a set of error logs, you should begin by analyzing the logs for at least a paragraph and trying to identify the cause of the error. After you've identified the issue, you should add steps to resolve the issue to your checklist before proceeding and continue looping through the process identified in [checklists.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/checklists.mdc) and [docs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/docs.mdc).
